## Hi, I'm Angad Singh! 👋

# Aspiring Data Scientist | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Generative AI & LLM Explorer

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a data enthusiast with a strong background in data analysis and a passion for cutting-edge technologies like deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and generative AI. My journey into data science began with uncovering insights from raw data, but my ultimate goal is to advance into the world of AI and machine learning, where I can build intelligent systems that transform industries.

# 🔍 What I’m Passionate About

Deep Learning: I am fascinated by neural networks, particularly in their application to complex problems in vision, language, and speech. I’m constantly learning more about architectures like CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.
LLMs (Large Language Models): I’m diving deep into transformer models like GPT, BERT, and T5, and exploring their ability to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. I’m particularly excited about their applications in NLP, text generation, and semantic search.
Generative AI: From text generation and image synthesis to creative applications like AI art and music generation, I’m intrigued by how AI can be used to generate new content. I aspire to work on projects that leverage generative models like GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models to create innovative solutions.

# 🛠 What I’m Currently Working On

Building machine learning and deep learning models to tackle real-world problems such as classification, regression, and clustering.
Working with PyTorch and TensorFlow to experiment with and implement deep learning architectures.
Learning about and experimenting with LLMs and NLP techniques, including fine-tuning pre-trained models and building chatbots, text summarization tools, and question-answering systems.
Exploring Generative AI applications such as text-to-image generation, style transfer, and AI-powered creativity tools.

# 🌱 What I’m Learning

Diving deeper into transformer-based models, particularly how they can be used for language understanding and generation.
Learning advanced techniques in model fine-tuning, transfer learning, and hyperparameter optimization.
Expanding my knowledge of Generative AI to work on creative tasks such as art generation, audio synthesis, and video generation using GANs and other generative models.

# 💡 Future Goals

Excel as a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on AI-driven solutions for complex data problems.
Build scalable LLM-powered systems for real-world applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and personalization engines.
Contribute to open-source projects related to AI, Deep Learning, and Generative AI to enhance community-driven learning and innovation.
Develop innovative applications using Generative AI that merge creativity with AI technology.

# 🎯 Beyond Tech

When I'm not working on tech projects, I enjoy challenging myself with a game of chess, delving into thought-provoking literature, and making informed choices about nutrition to maintain a balanced lifestyle.
